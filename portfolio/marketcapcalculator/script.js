/*
Example:
Given that the price of TOKEN closed at 18.76 USD on 2021-08-08, and the circulating supply of TOKEN was approximately 157,893,925 tokens, we can calculate the market capitalization of TOKEN as:

Market Capitalization = price of token x circulating supply

Data we need:
The circulating supply on a given date, and the price of the asset.

As an aside we can also calculate the fully diluted market capitalization of the asset with the following formula:

Fully Diluted Market Capitalization = price of token x total supply
